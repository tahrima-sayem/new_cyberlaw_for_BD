## INTRODUCTION

<p align="justify">
With the growing urge of digitalization, issues like cybercrime, data leaks, and online abuse are becoming more common. Many countries are updating their cyber laws to protect both security and people’s rights, like privacy and freedom of speech.<br>

Bangladesh is growing fast in the digital space through projects like Digital Bangladesh. But its main cyber law, the Digital Security Act 2018, has been criticized for being unclear and for possibly limiting free speech.<br>

To help create better and fairer cyber laws, this study looks at five peaceful countries—Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Switzerland, and the United States—based on the World Happiness Index. By studying their cyber laws, this study aim to suggest two new legal reforms that could make Bangladesh’s digital future safer and more respectful of people’s rights.
</p>

## EXISTING CYBER LAWS OF BANGLADESH

<p align="justify">
Bangladesh is moving forward with its “Digital Bangladesh” plan to modernize the country using technology. With more people using online platforms, mobile banking, and social media, strong and fair cyber laws are becoming more important. While some laws have been made to protect people online, many of them are outdated, unclear, or seen as limiting basic rights.
</p>

### **1. Digital Security Act (DSA), 2018**[1]  

**Key Points:**
- Covers cybercrimes like hacking, fraud, phishing, cyberbullying, and fake news
- Criminalizes defamation, hurting religious sentiment, and spreading false information online
- Established the Digital Security Agency and CERT (Computer Emergency Response Team)

**Issues:**
- Some sections (21, 25, 28, 29, 31) are vague and may be used to silence critics
- Police can arrest and search without a warrant in some cases
- Widely criticized for violating freedom of speech and press freedom by Human Rights Watch and others

### **2. Pornography Control Act, 2012**[2]
**Key Points:**
- Bans creating, sharing, and storing pornographic content, especially online
- Targets websites and digital platforms involved in pornography

**Issues:**
- Not clearly defined what content qualifies as pornography
- Weak enforcement on digital platforms, especially social media

### **3. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Act, 2006**[3]

**Key Points:**
- First major law to fight cybercrimes and support e-transactions
- Legalized electronic records and digital signatures
- Punishes crimes like hacking, identity theft, and data breaches

**Issues:**
- Section 57 was heavily criticized for vague language
- Led to arrests for social media posts, violating freedom of speech
- Section 57 was eventually removed



### **4. Telecommunication Act, 2001**[4]  

**Key Points:**
- Regulates telecom services and digital communication infrastructure
- Allows surveillance and control of telecom data for national security

<p align="justify">
Based on the strengths of cyber laws in peaceful and well-developed countries, Bangladesh now has a chance to improve its digital laws. The two proposals below are designed to protect people’s online rights and improve national cybersecurity, while making sure the government acts in a fair and responsible way.
</p>

# CONCLUSION
<p align="justify">
As Bangladesh grows its digital systems and connects more people online, it needs strong and modern cyber laws. Current laws are helpful but not enough to deal with new issues like data privacy, digital rights, and cybercrime.<br>

By learning from peaceful and advanced countries like Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Switzerland, and the USA, Bangladesh can create laws that protect both security and freedom. Clear and fair rules will also help people trust digital services more.<br>

The proposed laws—the Personal Data Protection Act and the Cyber Freedom and Rights Protection Act—aim to protect users and improve national cybersecurity. These changes can also support the digital economy and improve Bangladesh’s global image.<br>

To make this happen, the government should work with experts, tech professionals, civil groups, and the public. This teamwork can help build a safe and fair digital future for everyone.
